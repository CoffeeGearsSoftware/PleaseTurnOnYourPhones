# PleaseTurnOnYourPhones

Local server/wireless AP to distribute and coordinate a webapp to a local audience,
blurring the lines between audience members and performers.

The webapp would give each audience member a character to play and a line to say.

And then prompt them to act it out during the performance.

Other possible audience interaction:
  Votes and polls
  Excitement (shake phone to increase excite-o-meter)
