# Improv Idea 01 - Fiachna

## Scenario:  
Tech Company press release, debuting a prototype of their new phone, audience plays the part of Journalists, through the webapp we can give them questions to ask and we improvise the answers.

## Example

*[Enter Stage]*

**Fred the lead of design**: Hello everybody, could you all turn on your phones and turn up the volume please....

*[Audience does so]*

**Fred the lead of design**: These prototype phones have been provided to you by 'Snapple' in order for you to demo them, to see a full list of the specifications go to this website:

*[Lead the audience to the Webapp this way, it feels natural this way rather than just asking them out of character]*

*[Webapp shows them a list of questions to ask, maybe character profiles as well etc, it should encourage them to make up their own questions as wel]l*

***We could think of answers to the questions beforehand but I think it's funnier and better if we don't.***

***Idea: We could have a scene before this showing some businessman going to the press release having an accident, so they grab Fred the Janitor who knows nothing about the phones to do the Press talk, this means Fred can make up things about the phones on the spot, promises and that can have consequences in later improv***

**Audience member A**: ''So what makes these phones competitive with similar products on the market?''

**Fred**: ''Ummmmm, well.....(He has no clue...he is a Janitor)......They have two screens......One underneath the other so if one breaks the second one is....still working...

*(Not prompted by webapp, makes up own question)*

**Audience member B**:  ''How do you activate the second screen once the first breaks?''

**Fred**: ''It's always turned  on''

**Audience member C**: ''Won't that drain the battery?''

**Fred**: We are going to have uh, a network of solar collecting satellites that will constantly beam power to your phone......so you will never run out of battery...''

***Questions continue etc, Fred makes up shit etc. ***

***Fred can end the questioning at any time, once enough "material" has been built up throughout the improvising around the questions (preset & audience created)***

***Once questions are done second phase of Improv begins***

***Enter second performer, lets say playing the CEO of the company but they could be anyone really, just somebody to interact with Fred after his ordeal and they must bring up some sort of consequence from what has happened in the conference otherwise it is meaningless, anyway for the time being lets pretend its the CEO***

***Improv starts based on the established information created in the press release, for instance if Performer B is the CEO and Fred made up loads of shit with satellites etc they can improvise around the CEO going crazy about how they are going to meet the Promises Fred made to the media...Or maybe the CEO thinks its a fantastic idea, and thinks Fred is a genius, promotes him, or maybe they fall in love, It doesn't matter which way it goes it's Improv it will be up to the actors.***

***As long as it doesn't ignore what has already happened, things have been established and need to be addressed, again it's improv anything can happen, perhaps Fred just did a really good job and the Press release went really well in which case the Improvisation could take a totally different route where it largely isn't influence by what happened before.***

***Depending on what happens we could move to another scene with new performer or character E.G. a lawyer, therapist or prostitute I dunno: POSSIBLE SCENARIO: Fred does a terrible job, CEO tries to kill him, CEO gets sent to jail, Fred goes to a therapist to deal with Trauma, another performer jumps in as that character and a new improv begins (Assuming we have actors to spare, if not then the CEO could just change characterization to the Therapist)***

***Head towards solving problems and then maybe end with another press release with more audience participation (At this point the probably won't even need prompting or prewritten questions)***

So yeah.....Thoughts guys?
